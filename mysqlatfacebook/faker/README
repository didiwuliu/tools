InnoDB fake changes based replication prefetcher

Dependencies:
	* MySQL Client libraries
	* GLib2 runtime
	* MySQL Server with InnoDB fake changes 
	  (MySQL@Facebook or Percona Server) and InnoDB-only tables

Running:
	Username and password can be specified either with -u/-p or
	via properties file (-f) which has simple format:

		mysql_user faker
		mysql_pass secret

	Standard my.cnf and ~/.my.cnf specifications will work fine too. 

	Running on a system that has no support or uses tables not
	covered by fake changes support will break things.
